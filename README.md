│ ├─static  //Static file directory, this directory will be completely copied to the release directory
│ ├─theme
│ │ ├─template
│ │ │ ├─doc.tpl //document template file (not required, if not, use the software default template)
│ ├─index.md    //Home(not required)
│ ├─SUMMARY.md  //use to generate menu(required)
